    <description><![CDATA[
SpaceSniffer is a **freeWare** (donations are welcome) and **portable** tool application that lets you understand how folders and files are structured on your disks. By using a [Treemap](http://www.cs.umd.edu/hcil/treemap-history/) visualization layout, you have immediate perception of where big folders and files are placed on your devices. [Treemap](http://www.cs.umd.edu/hcil/treemap-history/) concept was invented by [Prof. Ben Shneiderman](http://www.cs.umd.edu/~ben/), who kindly permitted the use of his concept into this tool.

Start a scan process and see the overall situation. Bigger are the elements on the view, bigger are folders and files on your disk. You need more detail on a big folder? Just **single click on it**. The selected element will be detailed with its content.

Need more and more detail? Keep selecting elements and they'll discover their secrets to you. Need a larger view of a small folder? Then **double click on it**, and it'll zoom to the full extent of the view.

If you need to understand why no more free space is left on media, keep following bigger elements. Maybe you want to focus only on particular file types... ok. Just **type the file type** on the filter field (example: _*.jpg_) and press enter. The view will react and show you only JPEG files.
Want to exclude files? Then type a starting pipe before the filter (example: _|*.jpg_) and press enter. The view will show everything but JPEG files.

If you want to keep track of examined files **you can tag them**. Four colors are available. Just hover the mouse on a file and press `CTRL+1` to tag it red. There are keys also for yellow, green and blue tagging. Use them as you wish. You can also filter on tags (example: _:red_ will show only red tagges files, _:all_ will show all tagged files and so on). You can also exclude tagged files (example: _|:red_ will exclude all red tagged files)

Want to know if you have old files? Type the condition in the filter field (example: _>2years_) and the view will react accordingly.

You can also filter on **file size, file date** and combine all filters
(example: _*.jpg;>1mb;<3months;|:yellow_)

Once you have your result, you can produce a textual report by using the embedded **Export Module**. You can even customize the report layout to match your needs.
